### Anything else?
I made this for the Hack Club High Seas as a way for people to see how the speed of objects and the angle change things in a (hopefully) fun way. ‚ù§
I wanted to create something interactive that could help people visualize concepts like velocity, trajectory, and how objects move in a space. It was a fun challenge, and I hope you enjoy experimenting with it!
Feel free to play around with the controls, add new shapes, and see how things change as you adjust the speed and angle!
